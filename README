            OPSWAT Gears Agent - Community Version



What is it?
-----------

OPSWAT Gears is a monitoring and management product that provides
device visibility and compliance reporting for corporate-owned
and BYOD devices. It collects basic information about the system.
It does not collect personal or sensitive information. All data
is transmitted using TLS encryption to Gears servers where it is
used to compute device compliance against a security policy baseline.

This is the open source version of the end-point agent.
It provides almost all of the same functionality as the closed-
source version except it does not include a copy of the OESIS
libraries for detection and manageability, specifically for
antivirus-related features and firewall-related features.
